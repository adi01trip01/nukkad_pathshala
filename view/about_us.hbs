				<p class="card-text">We are folks coming from diverse educational and cultural background who came together to form a societal group. We are lucky to currently
									 have engineers, actor, writer, techie and laywer in our team. We are privileged enough to have a childhood where we needed not to worry about
									 how we will reach to school. However, soon the realization struck that there are children in our small city who have to cross barriers of hunger,
									 malaise and labour before they can even have a look at school. Education is still far-sighted to them. We are devoted to transform the lives of children
									 who came from inferior strata of our society and could not have access to free education  owing to the social issues they are bounded by since birth.</p>

			  <div class="card-body bg-warning">
				<p class="card-text">Aiming to make education easily accessible for every child, we pitched the idea to start regular classes close to homes of children
                       who can reach to school, owing to the reasons beyond their control and chocies. Our mission is to provide underprivilaged with the opportunity
                       to kindle the passion for knowledge within themselves and to help them have a better perspective towards the society. We are aiming to progressively
                       engage more and more into education through our project.
